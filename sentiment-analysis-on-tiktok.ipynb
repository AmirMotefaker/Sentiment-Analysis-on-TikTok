It is famous for its short videos. People often use this app to watch entertaining and funny videos. Despite its entertaining content, this application is not liked by everyone. If you skim through its reviews, you’ll find a mixture of hate and support for TikTok all over the world. Let’s analyze TikTok reviews to find out what people feel about the content of this app.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset\n\n- TikTok, known in China as Douyin (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a video-focused social networking service owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. It hosts a variety of short-form user videos, from genres like pranks, stunts, tricks, jokes, dance, and entertainment with durations from 15 seconds to ten minutes.\n\n- TikTok is an international version of Douyin, which was originally released in the Chinese market in September 2016.\n\n- TikTok was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018.\n\n- TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, but features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them and other features such as buying, booking hotels and making geo-tagged reviews. Since its launch in 2016, TikTok and Douyin rapidly gained popularity in virtually all parts of the world. As of October 2020, TikTok surpassed over 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok)\n\n- This dataset belongs to the TikTok app available on the Google Play Store. The Dataset mostly has user reviews and the various comments made by the users.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport string\nimport re\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nstemmer = nltk.SnowballStemmer(\"english\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-05T13:35:28.088692Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-05T13:35:28.089473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-05T13:35:30.232587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-05T13:35:28.089431Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-05T13:35:30.231361Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/tiktok-google-play-store-review/tiktok_google_play_reviews.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-05T13:35:30.235095Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-05T13:35:30.23588Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.268283Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-05T13:35:30.235823Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.267166Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.274807Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.275162Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.294504Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.275132Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-05T13:35:35.293193Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- On the first impressions of this dataset, I can see null values in some columns.
