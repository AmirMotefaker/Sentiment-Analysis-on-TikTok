It hosts a variety of short-form user videos, from genres like pranks, stunts, tricks, jokes, dance, and entertainment with durations from 15 seconds to ten minutes.\n","\n","- TikTok is an international version of Douyin, which was originally released in the Chinese market in September 2016.\n","\n","- TikTok was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018.\n","\n","- TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, but features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them and other features such as buying, booking hotels and making geo-tagged reviews. Since its launch in 2016, TikTok and Douyin rapidly gained popularity in virtually all parts of the world. As of October 2020, TikTok surpassed over 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok)\n","\n","- This dataset belongs to the TikTok app available on the Google Play Store. The Dataset mostly has user reviews and the various comments made by the users."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"26b08e78","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001756,"end_time":"2023-05-04T14:58:36.269717","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-04T14:58:36.267961","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"799709ea","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-04T14:58:36.275607Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-04T14:58:36.275122Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-04T14:58:38.173053Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-04T14:58:38.171059Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.903941,"end_time":"2023-05-04T14:58:38.175633","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-04T14:58:36.271692","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.23.5\n","  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /usr/share/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nltk/twitter/__init__.py:20: UserWarning: The twython library has not been installed.
